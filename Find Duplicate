# Q. Find Duplicate
# i/p : a = [1,2,3,4,4]
# o/p : 4
# explanation : In array of size n containing each no. between 1 and n-1 at least once. There is single 
#               integer value that is present twice in array. find that duplicate integer value.

a = [1,2,3,3,4]
size = len(a)
duplicate = 0

for i in range(0,size,1):
  duplicate = duplicate^a[i]

for j in range(1,size,1):
  duplicate = duplicate^j
  
print(duplicate)
